## Nuxt Starter
This is a simple but full functional starter for [Nuxt framework](https://nuxt.com/)

### About
It basically contains the same as [Nuxt Starter on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz) encouraged by Nuxt team to provide minimal bug reproduction, but without `<NuxtWelcome>` component and with additional [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration for static JS code analysis, which I found very useful and worth adopting from your very first steps.

I recommend this setup for learning and testing purposes or for simple projects only. As a starting point for a real application, I'd advise you consider picking my [`nuxt-stack`](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/nuxt-stack) which is combined with more useful features and integrations.

If you want to learn more about Nuxt, visit my [`demos-nuxt`](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/demos-nuxt) project with tutorials and examples.

### How to use
1. `git checkout nuxt-starter project`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` 
4. `localhost:3000` 

Congratulations. You have working Nuxt app project enhanced with ESLint and you can start building atop it.
